# Software Project Demo

<Segment raised>

This website is built using [ActiveMDX](https://active-mdx.soederpop.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

ActiveMDX allows us to develop content models for domain specific writing. In this case, the writing is software project requirements for the purposes of planning a software project's delivery.

The source code for this project plan is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/soederpop/active-mdx-software-project-starter).
